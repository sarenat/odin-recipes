        <p>
            This quintessential rice dish of Vietnamese pork chops is 
            packed with flavor, super easy to make, and a crowd pleaser!
        </p>

            The marinade adds a ton of garlicky, lemongrassy flavor that 
            pairs great with the pork chops. Grilling adds an amazing 
            aroma and sear, and as if the chops aren’t flavorful enough, 
            they’re topped with scallions & oil.

                </ul>
            <li>Marinade Aromatics</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>6 tablespoons lemongrass, minced</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons garlic, minced</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons shallots, minced</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Veggies and Garnish</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 tomato, sliced</li>
                    <li>1 cucumber, sliced</li>
                    <li>6 leaves green leaf lettuce</li>
                </ul>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Rinse pork chops under running water and lightly scrub 
                with salt. Pat dry with paper towels.
            </li>
            <li>Combine all marinade ingredients in a medium mixing bowl 
                and stir to combine and dissolve sugar and MSG. Then add 
                the Marinade Aromatics.
            </li>
            <li>Marinade the pork chops in a bowl or bag in the fridge 
                for at least 3 hours, but ideally overnight.
            </li>
            <li>Remove the chops from the marinade and discard the extra 
                liquid–you can keep the aromatics on that stuck to the 
                chops though.
            </li>
            <p><b>Cooking:</b></p>
            <li><b>Grill</b> on a BBQ, giving at least 1-2 inches spacing 
                between each chop. Sear on high heat for browning or grill 
                marks for a few minutes, then lower to medium heat and 
                cook on both sides, flipping often until cooked all the 
                way through. When done, the pork should read 145 °F using 
                an instant read thermometer at the thickest part of the cut.
            </li>
            <li><b>Pan fry:</b> 1-2 chops at a time on medium to medium 
                high heat without crowding the pan. When done, the pork 
                should read 145 °F using an instant read thermometer at
                the thickest part of the cut.
            </li>
            <li><b>In the oven:</b> Bake at 375 °F for 15-20 minutes 
                until the internal temperature of the meat hits around 
                135 °F. Lower the rack and broil, flipping a few times
                during broiling, to get nice coloring on both sides. 
                Again, the pork is done when the internal temp reaches 
                145 °F.
            </li>
            <li>Serve with a side of rice, veggies & garnish, and nuoc 
                cham (dipping/prepared fish sauce).
            </li>
        </ol>
