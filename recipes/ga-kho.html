        <p>
            Gà kho is an aromatic, sweet, spicy, and pungent yet 
            balanced combination of flavors that pair amazingly 
            well with chicken. It’s quite easy to make too! 
        </p>
        <p>
            Whether it be fish steaks, poultry, beef, hunks of 
            pork, or sausage; everything has a version of the 
            caramelized cooking method. And why not? 
            Caramelization creates a delicious sauce that is 
            savory, sweet, spicy, salty, and thick enough to nicely 
            coat whichever meat you decide to cook.

                    <li>1 shallot</li>
                    <li>3 cloves of garlic</li>
                    <li>vegetable oil for frying</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Final Additions/Garnish</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 sprigs of scallion</li>
                    <li>1 jalapeno</li>
                    <li>1 Thai chili</li>
                </ul>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Marinade in about 2 tablespoons fish sauce and 1
                tablespoons brown sugar for a least 1 hour. Rotate 
                and redistribute marinade after the first 30 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Combine for the sauce: 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup 
                fish sauce, 1/4 cup rice vinegar, 1/4 cup water.
            </li>
            <li>Then add to the sauce 1 tablespoon minced ginger, 
                1 minced shallot, and 3 cloves minced garlic.
            </li>
            <li>Heat a pan on high heat, then add some vegetable oil. 
                Add the chicken and rotate as it browns. This should 
                only take a 1-2 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Turn down the heat to about medium so the chicken can 
                cook through.
            </li>
            <li>Add some of the sauce, just enough to color and kind of 
                baste the meat as it cooks.
            </li>
            <li>You could add the rest of the sauce now too, but I 
                find it makes more sense to cook them separately so you 
                can control the doneness of the chicken and thickness 
                of the sauce independently.
            </li>
            <li>Remove the chicken. Add the rest of the sauce and cook 
                on medium high heat until it just reaches desired 
                consistency.
            </li>
            <li>Remove the chicken. Add the rest of the sauce and cook 
                on medium high heat until it just reaches desired consistency.
            </li>
        </ol>
