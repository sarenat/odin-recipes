        <p>
            Fresh lemongrass, with its signature delicate, tangy, 
            lemony, minty, slightly-gingery flavor, is the starring 
            ingredient here and somehow transforms a simple garlic-soy 
            marinade into one that tastes fabulously fresh and light. 
            And once it’s paired with lightly-charred juicy chicken — 
            either grilled, baked or sautéed — I’m telling you, this 
            slightly-sweet, savory, citrusy combo is downright irresistible.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you’re new to working with lemongrass, don’t worry — it’s 
            a really simple ingredient to use and I will walk you through 
            everything you need to know. So scout out a few stalks the next 
            time you’re at the grocery store, and let’s make some lemongrass 
            chicken together!
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Chicken</li>
            <li>Lime juice</li>
            <li>Fish sauce</li>
            <li>Sweetener</li>
            <li>Soy-sauce</li>
            <li>Oil</li>
            <li>Garlic</li>
            <li>Shallot</li>
            <li>Lemongrass</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Make the marinade.</b> I like to just toss all of the marinade 
                ingredients into a blender or food processor and puree 
                until smooth. But that said, if you would like to make the 
                marinade by hand, you can finely dice the garlic/shallot/lemongrass 
                by and then whisk all of the marinade ingredients together 
                in a bowl until combined. Up to you!
            </li>
            <li><b>Marinate the chicken.</b> Cut the chicken into bite-sized 
                pieces, if you are cooking it on skewers as I have 
                photographed here. Or if using whole breasts or thighs, 
                use a meat mallet to pound the chicken to even thickness. 
                Then toss the chicken with the marinade in a large bowl 
                until evenly coated, and let the chicken rest for about 30 
                minutes.
            </li>
            <li><b>Cook.</b> Once the chicken is all marinated and ready 
                to go, grill, bake or sauté the chicken until cooked 
                through. (See more detailed instructions below.)  Let the 
                chicken rest for 3-5 minutes afterwards, before serving.
            </li>
            <li><b>Serve.</b> Then serve it nice and warm, garnished with 
                green onions plus an extra squeeze or two of lime juice. 
                Delicious!
            </li>
